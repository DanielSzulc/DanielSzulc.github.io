### The Motto
> Data science has value as long as it delivers actionable insights to the business. This blog is a place where I want to bring the both worlds together.  


It is not about data. Even big data.  
It is not about statistical models. Even very sophisticated ones.  
It is not about any technology. Even very hot buzz words like Hadoop, Spark, cloud.  
It is not about charts and data visualisations. Even the most beautiful ones.  
At the end of a day, it is about money.  
Big data has to lead to big money. Otherwise, it makes no sense.  
Especially in business.
