### My Motto
> Data science has value as long as it brings actionable insights to the business. And this blog is a place where I want to bring those both worlds together.  

Thinking about data science for business. What do you believe is it about?  
It is not about data. Even big data.  
It is not about statistical models. Even very sophisticated ones.  
It is not about any technology. Even very hot buzz words like Hadoop, Spark, Cloud  
It is not about charts and data visualisations. Even the most beautiful ones.  
At the end of a day, it is only about money.  
Big data has to lead to big money. Otherwise, it makes no sense.
